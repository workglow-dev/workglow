 * method, so a check written on `foo` was silently absent from `tx.foo`. That
 * cost three fixes — `tx.deleteSearch({})` turning from a no-op into a `DELETE
 * FROM t WHERE` syntax error and criteria excluding nothing into a truncated
 * table; `tx.updateWhere` rewriting a row's identity where the same call
 * outside a transaction threw; `tx.getBulk([])` reaching DuckDB as `IN ()` —
 * and each could only restate the guard in the private method.
 *
 * `createTxView` now leaves the public methods in place and neutralizes only
 * the mutex, so `tx.foo(args)` runs `foo`. Parity is a property of the routing
 * rather than of anyone's diligence, and this block is what says so out loud:
 * every guard below is written once, on the public method, and asserted on both
 * paths, over a set of methods derived from the object rather than written down.
