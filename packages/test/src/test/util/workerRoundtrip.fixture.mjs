/**
 * Worker-thread fixture for WorkerManager.roundtrip.test.ts.
 *
 * Speaks the WorkerManager wire protocol by hand rather than importing
 * `@workglow/util/worker`. A thread spawned by `worker_threads` is resolved by
 * the runtime, not by vitest, so a `@workglow/*` specifier here resolves
 * through `exports` to `dist` — which under `use-source` is a stub re-exporting
 * an extensionless `../src/*.ts` path that plain Node cannot resolve. The test
 * would then pass or fail on whether the tree was built or stubbed, rather than
 * on the code under test.
 *
 * It does mirror one thing `Worker.node.ts` relies on: replies go out through
 * `parentPort`, and messages arrive via `parentPort.addEventListener` as a
 * `MessageEvent` with a `.data`. Node worker threads have no global
 * `postMessage` at all, so a fixture written the other way would only ever run
 * under Bun.
 *
 * Plain `.mjs` (not `.ts`) so `worker_threads` can launch it directly under the
 * Node runtime vitest uses, with no TypeScript transform step.
