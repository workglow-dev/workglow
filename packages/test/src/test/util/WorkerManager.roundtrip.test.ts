/**
 * Drives {@link WorkerManager} over a real worker thread, spawned through the
 * `Worker` that `@workglow/util` exports for this runtime.
 *
 * Every other worker suite in the repo substitutes the thread: the idle tests
 * use a `FakeWorker`, and the `WorkerServerBase` tests stub
 * `globalThis.postMessage`. That left the whole `worker_threads` adaptation
 * uncovered, and it was broken in two places that a single real round trip
 * catches:
 *
 * - `worker_threads` rejects a stringified `file://` URL with `ERR_WORKER_PATH`,
 *   and every call site passes `new URL(..., import.meta.url)`, so construction
 *   threw before the worker ever started.
 * - Node's `Worker` is an `EventEmitter`, so a `message` listener receives the
 *   deserialized value, not a `MessageEvent`. `WorkerManager` reads
 *   `event.data`, which was `undefined` — the ready handshake never resolved
 *   and registration timed out after 10s.
 *
 * The same file runs under Bun, which is the point: Bun implements worker
 * threads over the same primitive as its web `Worker`, so one implementation
 * serves both and there is no Bun-specific build to keep in step.
