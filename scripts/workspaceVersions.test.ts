 * **Every workspace moves together.** One version across the whole tree,
 * matched by the workspace root and by the single tag the cut writes, so any
 * two packages a consumer installs are the pair that were built and tested
 * together. The release cut is `--all` for that reason, and this measures the
 * result rather than trusting the flag: a hand-edited version, a half-applied
 * bump, or a cut that quietly ran `--changed` all land here, named one by one.
 *
 * The four never-published workspaces — `@workglow/test`, `@workglow/aws`,
 * `@workglow/cloudflare`, `@workglow/web` — are in the lockstep too, and this
 * guard does not exempt them. Their version buys nothing on its own, but an
 * exception costs more to remember than it saves, and it would leave
 * `@workglow/test` disagreeing with the packages it tests about which release
 * they belong to.
 *
 * **What they ARE held out of is publishing, and the two spellings of that
 * have to agree.** `publish-workspaces.ts` keys on
 * `publishConfig.access === "public"`; anything keyed on a package being
 * unreleased reads `private: true`. `examples/web` satisfied the first while
 * carrying no `private` flag, which is the shape that goes wrong quietly, so
 * both directions are pinned here: an unpublished package must be private, and
 * a private one must not be something the publish step would try to ship —
 * `bun publish` refuses a private manifest.
